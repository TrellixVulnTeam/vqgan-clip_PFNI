There was once upon a time a peasant-woman who had a daughter and a step-daughter. The daughter had her own way in everything, and whatever she did was right in her mother's eyes; but the poor step-daughter had a hard time.
======================================
 At first her stepsisters spoiled her, and made her stay out of her own room; but when she had been married for three years, they said that the stepmother was nagging them, and they had to get their own dinner on the table, and had to go to bed at eleven. The poor step-daughter longed to be their own mistress, but could not get up enough courage to ask the old lady to let her. Then one evening she made up her mind to get even, and went downstairs in a great rage, and got all her porridge and things out of the stove, and poured them down the hall-stairs and all over the parlour. Then she ran and hid herself under a bed, and began to sob, for she was angry. Then her step-mother came up, and she had to beg and cry before she could get any comfort.

When she got up, she felt all right again, and so she took out her keys, and opened the parlour, and soon set to work to mop up all the mess. She worked so hard that at last she could not help crying with pain.
