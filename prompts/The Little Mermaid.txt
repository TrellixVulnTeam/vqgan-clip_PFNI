Far out in the ocean the water is as blue as the petals of the loveliest cornflower, and as clear as the purest glass. But it is very deep too.
======================================
 The bottom of the sea is covered with a firm, yellow sand, and the water above is like a vast reef of glass.

In the deepest spot of all sits the sea witch, in her magic chair. "Why, little sister," says she, "so you come to claim what is yours." I beg your pardon, "says the little mermaid.

"I ought to have asked before whom I was welcome." "Is it so long since you came?" asks the witch. "No," says the little mermaid, "not long enough." "Well, then, you have a long journey before you," says the witch.

"I should not take you back through the glass again." "I should not go back through the glass again," says the little mermaid, "unless I were bound to do so." "You ought to be bound," says the witch.

"Come with me to my cabin, and we will see about that." And then the little mermaid went to the witch's cabin. The cabin was full of sprites and gnomes, with coins swinging from their ears, and with lanterns burning to the top of the trees. The windows were as bright as midday.
