Once upon a time, a widow had an only son whose name was Aladdin. They were very poor and lived from hand to mouth, though Aladdin did what he could to earn some pennies, by picking bananas in faraway places.
======================================


One day, on a rainy day, when he was very wet, he sat down under a tree to rest and after an hour's rest, he opened his sack to see what he had to eat and there was a genie inside the bag, and the genie said to Aladdin, "Open your heart."

"Thank you, genie," said Aladdin.

The genie helped Aladdin in many ways, to win over his heart.

The genie said, "Do you have a wish?"

"Yes, I have a wish," said Aladdin.

"You shall not tell your mother or I will have you burnt," said the genie.

"I will tell my mother," said Aladdin.

"Do not tell your mother," said the genie.

"I will tell her as soon as we are safe," said Aladdin.

"If you do, she will not be with you to save you when I tell her your wish," said the genie.

Aladdin felt sorry about what the genie had said, and told the genie to remain in the sack. He would give him a box to keep in the hole. When he returned home, he would open the box. Inside the box there would be gold and rubies. The genie promised.
