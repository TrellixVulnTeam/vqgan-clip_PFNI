It was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful.
======================================


The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the French language, which he had learnt from his wife, a French nanny who had treated the children very well.

In the background stood tall pines trees, thickets of briars, and thick grass.

'I shall like it very much here,' thought the little prince, 'but God has made it known to me, by all the flowers, that He has particular plans for me, and that now I must start in my journey.

How thoughtful He is, that even in the most idle moments of my life, He gives me something to think about. '

So he wandered about, he examined the ground all about him, he dug in the sand with his sharp snout, and he ate the cactus fruit.

After eating it, he said: 'It is the loveliest thing I have ever tasted!'

Then he saw a splendid swimming pool, in the midst of the finest green grass.

It was so clean and clear that you could see the water all through it, and it looked like crystal.
