A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms.
======================================


One day a kindly Man appeared, and asked, "Why do you keep going around and around in the same spot? Won't you eat any of the worms you find?"

"Why should I eat them?" said Little Red Hen. "They're good for more than one thing; they make good bread and they fill my belly right up."

The Man was impressed by this response.

"I believe you've learned a valuable lesson, Little Red Hen," he said.

"How?" said the little hen.

"When you want to do a good deed, don't ask for a lot in return. Simply ask yourself what you can give."

From then on, Red Hen never gathered up wood for the Man; she did her chores, and went home and made bread and fed her chickens. And the Man was a very happy man.

What lesson does that teach us?

1. Gather up what you find. Look around to see what you can contribute to your life.

2. Don't always ask for a lot in return. You may not get any, but the universe may give you what you need.

3. What you give comes back to you tenfold.

4. For every positive thing
