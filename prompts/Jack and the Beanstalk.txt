Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow.
======================================


To pay the money, Jack’s mother told him that he would need to sell one of his kidneys.

Being a proud boy, Jack refused.

This made his mother sad.

So one day, Jack came home from school and saw a man selling a rusty car.

Jack persuaded his mother that they would need this car.

So, the next day, they bought the car.

However, since they needed to move the car, they put it in the backyard.

The next day, Jack’s mother told him that they now need to sell the cow in order to pay for school supplies. Jack asked his mother if she could help with the cow. His mother responded by putting her hands on her hips and saying “This is the work of my son.”

Job 23:1-5 Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto Job, Lord, thou wilt surely make thy servant go in after this manner of speaking; or rather, I will take him as a king’s clerk in thy courts. And he said, Job, thou hast lived a long time, and thou hast other charge besides this.
