In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that?
======================================
 She had to walk everywhere barefoot.

On, on, in that bitter, raging weather, she was led to the boat. The oarsmen grunted, and the old oarsman cried out: "Pull! Whoo-ee!"

"Pull, whoo-ee!" screamed the little girl, forgetting her hunger. She pulled, she pulled as hard as she could; and the oarsmen pushed harder than they could; but to no purpose. The hole, though big enough for an adult, was not big enough for an eight-year-old girl; and at last the boat was empty.

"Take my little girl to a land of plenty," they shouted.

"Now, now," said the old oarsman, "pull her into the boat."

And they pulled, and they pulled, but the boat would not move.

"Hark! Who's there? Don't be afraid, I only have to give her some bread, and she shall never come back to me."

"Take it," said the little girl, snatching the bread out of the old man's hand.

And the old man kissed her on the cheek. And they all began to argue again, as they had been doing for half a day.
