Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen.
======================================


She had not a sole to go upon, for her deceased husband had left her absolutely bankrupt.

She came from a mighty family and had been taught how to take care of herself; not to be ignorant or not to complain, and so on, and so forth.

This lady found the most perfidious means to raise her family by being mean to her children, so that they might grow to be always agreeable to her.

The house was a great ruin, and the children even tried to fight her to their sorrow.

The woman's brother died, and the estate left her in great distress.

She applied to her husband for some help, but he did not wish to give it.

She went to him and begged him to restore the house to her.

"But," she said, "I must have some money in advance."

"Nonsense," said he, "you had not one day's trouble."

"My fortune," said she, "has fallen by the wayside.

I have lost everything."

"Your money," said he, "is not the secret of success.

Pray, we must return to our old home."
