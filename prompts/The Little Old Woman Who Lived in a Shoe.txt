Once on a time there was a Little Old Woman who lived in a Shoe.
======================================


She had so many children that she didn't know what to do.

So she said "My kids are outside playing, I'm inside the house with my feet on the furniture shouting at them to come and get their shoes on."

One day, Little Old Woman had so many kids going in and out of her house that her house was in a mess.

She needed help but nobody would listen.

So she called out "Would someone please help me get my house in order.

I just can't keep up with the kids."

A Man got on a bus with a guitar case.

He sat in the first seat and kept the case in his lap.

When the bus began to move, he removed his headset and took the guitar out of the case.

The man played an incredible melody on the guitar.

Everyone on the bus was enchanted.

The man played for thirty minutes until the bus reached his stop.

"That was amazing," the man said to the driver.

"Where are you headed?"

"That's my house," the driver said.

"Why are you bringing that guitar with you?"

"My wife wanted me to bring my guitar."
