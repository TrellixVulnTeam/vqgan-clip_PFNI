In the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far from the open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree.
======================================


Its very gnarled branches were like so many vultures-there were lots of vultures back in the days when we knew the old days, and they still haunted the sea, or so the story went.

In the old days people thought of such things.

People thought of them often.

And then, in the distance, we heard it.

It was a loud hollow sound that sounded as if it came from a mile off, in a rocky cliff.

If you listen to the echoes of such things long enough, you come to understand that they come from far off, and are never really near.

There was no wind, but we heard the sound that had come from such a distance a mile off, and we heard it coming from all around us.

It seemed to come from all directions, and to not move away from us.

"And then the clouds from the distant storm-clouds began to pour down lightening upon us.

We could not see the lightning from here, but the lightening, which had been no more than a dim and slow whisper, began to roar from afar.
