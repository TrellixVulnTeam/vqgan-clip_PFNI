A shoemaker, by no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he had nothing left but leather for one pair of shoes.
======================================


He went from house to house, but nobody would take him for a shinner.

The cause of his poverty was that a wild boar had run into his cart and eaten all his shoes, so he was obliged to walk about in foot - binding shoes.

"Father - in - law," said the girl, "go into the town and speak to the seller of shoes.

He will give you a pair of them.

But look at them carefully."

The poor shoemaker went into the town, where he found a wonderful shoemaker's shop.

The windows were covered with glass so that no light could get in, but every pair of shoes in the shop were new and shined like mirrors.

"I am the best shoemaker in the whole wide world," said the shoemaker; and he took a pair of shining shoes out of a box, and began to polish them.

"Don't you think that my shoes are good enough for you?" said the shoemaker.

"Not a bit," replied the girl.

"Look how beautiful they are.

Take them and give them to me.

I will show them to Father - in - law and he will be very glad."
