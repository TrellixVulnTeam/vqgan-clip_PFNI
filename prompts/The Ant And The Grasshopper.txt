One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.
======================================


'I am extremely poor,' he said, 'and even my friend the Ants have nothing to spare.

Have pity on me!

I am a personage of wealth compared to you. '

In the end the Grasshopper succeeded in getting a meal, but as he was eating he wept bitterly because he could not help thinking that there was a huge difference between himself and the Ants, who, though they lived in ease and plenty, were as poor as the rest of the earth's creatures.

The grateful Grasshopper thanked him all his life for this good deed.

So he and the Ants lived together in contented friendship, and, one fine day, left the countryside to go and make their homes in the rich woods of the plain.

And the Grasshopper never forgot the Ant who had shown him such love.

A thousand years and a thousand years, and the Grasshopper was still thinking of the poor Ant.

Then one day, a rich Queen and her bride were traveling through the wood, accompanied by a host of solemn - faced palace maids, all playing musical instruments.
