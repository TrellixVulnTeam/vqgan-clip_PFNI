One day, the cook went into the kitchen to make some gingerbread.
======================================


That afternoon, the tiger and her servant came by the courtyard.

The tiger pounced on the cook's throat and tore out her heart.

"Be a good girl, and I'll give you something good to eat," she said.

The tiger kept the cook's heart in its mouth, then jumped into the servant's skin and vanished.

The servant went into the kitchen to check on the gingerbread, but it had turned to sawdust.

The next day, the tiger came to the courtyard again, growling and warning the tiger that the cook's heart was still there.

So the servant stuffed the tiger's skin with sawdust and hid it in the storage room.

On the third day, the cook went into the kitchen to make the gingerbread, and, sure enough, it was gone.

When the tiger got back from hunting, it was surprised to find no heart for a meal.

"I have been here for three days without a proper meal," it roared.

"How can you get food without a proper heart?"

The tiger had no heart to give, so it decided to throw the cook in the river.
