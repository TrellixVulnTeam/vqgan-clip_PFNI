There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely.
======================================


And so she went about the house, singing as though her life depended upon it.

When she reached the dinner - table, she began to sing.

Her voice was pleasant, for she had been a teacher in her day.

'What a charming voice she has,' thought the old mother, and gave a sigh.

When the little girl heard her, she smiled.

As the old woman was reading her a bedtime story, she heard the singing, and looked up, and her eyes fell on a tin mug with the inscription, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."

She smiled, and asked, 'Mother, what's this?'

'Bless the Lord, my soul,' replied the old woman.

'Well, what's it for?' asked the little girl.

'It's for my drinking,' replied the old woman; and smiled, and gave the little girl her good night kiss.

'If we had an elder tree, would you like me to put the mug under it?' asked the girl.

'If you do, you must sing all night long,' said the old woman; and gave her the same kiss.

The girl thought this was a very odd custom.
