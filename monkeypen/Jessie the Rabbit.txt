Big Adventure

There are numerous fantastic local rides taking place in Peterborough throughout the summer. I was very tempted to take the two-mile trek up to Sherwood Edge for the Star Trail: 600ft drop, 40ft gain, one hairpin corner, two long drops and one speed bump! I also highly recommend the Asda Wheel'r, the super family ride which is great for little legs and gives you the opportunity to burn up to 600 calories.

Adult tickets are £16 per person, while children aged three to 17 years old pay just £7.50 and under-fives go free. Ticket prices for the rides are based on the number of people in the ride, and there are also daily 50p discount passes available if you purchase before 1 July.
