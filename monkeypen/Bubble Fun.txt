======================================


A hippo who can move under the ground. A dragon who wears the skin of a fish. Two ponies with a thirst for adventure. A frog whose tongue has turned into a camera. And a little mouse who thinks she's a ghost. These aren't just four friends, they are also four characters from Rainbow Rowell's most recent novel Fangirl. After two "heroes" from Fangirl's bestseller make it to "Book Club" on ABC's (wonderful) show When We Rise, they are to speak at an all-ages panel discussion. The panel of heroes arrives and join the kids to talk about their own coming of age stories. The heroes read a bit from their own books and then it's up to the kids to talk about their own "hero" experiences, at which point the superheroes begin to flip the book to page 52, where we get a wonderful description of Bucky Barnes' Secret Origin.

Captain America, one of the biggest and most prominent of the various heroes (readers) in the Marvel comic universe, is known for being strong, dependable, and sensitive.
