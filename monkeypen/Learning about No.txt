Sophia was excited. She was now in the 2nd grade and it was her first day of school. As she finished her breakfast, she looked out of the window and saw all her friends waiting for the bus.
======================================
 Her mum had promised her that she'd take her to the bus stop and wait with her. Sophia's mum had always taken her to school before, but today she had to work late at the office. She didn't mind though, Sophia's dad would pick her up after work.

Sophia got ready and ran to the bus stop. The other kids were already there. Sophia couldn't wait for the bus to arrive. "Mummy, why did you not take me to the bus stop?" asked Sophia.

Her mum had forgotten about it. "Sorry Sophia" was all her mum could say as she walked back to the house. Sophia was disappointed and started to cry. "I'm scared. I'm scared to go to the bus stop by myself".

Sophia's dad got home from work and saw Sophia's sad face. "I'm sorry Sophia. Your mother is working late again. She won't be able to pick you up until after 5pm"

Sophia's dad knew that Sophia's mum would probably forget the rest of the way to school, so he decided to walk Sophia to the bus stop. He put his arms around her and walked her to the bus stop.
