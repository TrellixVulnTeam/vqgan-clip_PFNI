Bill is on a bullying spree. He believes that he is the strongest animal on the farm and that gives him the right to do as he pleases. But the farm animals decide to stop him in his tracks by a great tale that moves at a quick pace, keeping the reader engrossed right to the end.
======================================


Littna Nelson's realistic watercolours are the perfect backdrop for the story. Her composition creates depth, texture and dimension. This book deserves a prominent place on your coffee table and a look after reading. The story moves with the same rhythm as one of Rachael Herron's works that I reviewed earlier.

In a nod to the big screen and author Roald Dahl's beloved children's classic, Great Expectations, Quicksand Boy is a boy who forges his own destiny after a magical experience in a sandpit.

We will be seeing more of Josh and his mom in Quicksand Boy's Land in the second edition in the coming weeks.

Children's author Michael Barnett, who works with wonderful illustrator Ross Maxwell, creates the mood in Quicksand Boy's Land perfectly.

Quicksand Boy's Land is available in hardback at the Douglas, Bruntwood and Border Books stores. It can also be ordered online from Border Books.
