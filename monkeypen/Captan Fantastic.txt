Princess Aura always has the best birthday parties and this year friends from all over the galaxy were heading to her planet to enjoy the celebrations.
======================================


Meredith, who recently had a baby boy, was preparing for a party that would be the envy of every parent.

Stuffed teddy bears were strewn around her bed, a chocolate cake sat atop her dresser, and decorations were placed throughout the house.

Tucking a strand of wavy hair behind her ear, she came back to the present.

It wasn't very often she would feel this way, so she quickly sat down and started thinking over the previous year.

It hadn't all been good.

There was her husband's self - imposed exile.

But that was only one of the reasons Meredith had to smile now.

Their children were living happily, and the world seemed to be prospering all around them.

She smiled as she thought of how proud she was of them and how she was going to make sure they always knew that.

As she reminisced, Meredith realized she had to get ready for her party.

The adults would be starting to arrive any minute now, and her children would be making some sort of a mess out of her beautiful house.
