In the rainforest, next to a wide river, there grew a great banyan tree. This tree was ancient and provided a home for the many animals living in the area.
======================================
 The tree had many large leaves, giving it the name of “the umbrella tree.” The leaves were also made into rope and carved into objects and used for decoration. The carvings depicted a human being, and the entire tree became known as a shrine.

To help protect this shrine, the local tribesmen would build a watchtower at its base. They would watch out for enemies, and in time, a village grew around the village watchtower. This village came to be known as Samaden, after the watchtower.

The Chieftain of Samaden was Tsin, and under his leadership the village prospered. Tsin managed the village well, and the animals of the forest also prospered. Tsin also appointed other kings and headmen who, in turn, governed the rest of the villages that grew around Samaden.

The animals of the forest grew fat from their prosperity. Tsin ruled over the animals of the forest well, but his health declined. He was worried that, soon, he would die. This fear caused Tsin to become weak and feeble.
