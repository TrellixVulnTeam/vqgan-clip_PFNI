Little Ross was sad. He didn’t have a nice new tricycle like all the other children. All he had was an old hand-me-down trike. After sulking he decided to do something about it and made a “trick trike” that was the envy of the neighborhood.
======================================
 This Christmas, the T’Pears will do anything to make sure little Ross’s Christmas is the best ever. If you can help them be as blessed as little Ross, you can donate through PayPal to PEARLS FOR ROSES at ww.ws/wirishtrck or www.wirishtrck.com.
