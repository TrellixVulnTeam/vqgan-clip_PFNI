Before time was time, there was a Great Hill. And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks. The Yolks spent their entire lives climbing the Great Hill, trying to reach the top.
======================================
 It was not a straight climb. In many places it was a series of large, exposed boulders that led to the summit. The Yolks had to be in top physical condition to make the climb. So every day they rose at dawn to begin the climb, by the light of the sun. They ate three sprigs of hollyhocks as a meal, and they drank fresh milk every day. And they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.

And all through the Great Hill they climbed.
